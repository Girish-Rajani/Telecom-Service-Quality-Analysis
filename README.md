# Telecom Service Quality Analysis

The telecommunications industry is a rapidly growing sector that is constantly evolving to meet the demands of consumers. As technology advances and user behavior changes, telecom operators face a variety of challenges that can impact their business success. In order to stay competitive and meet customer needs, it is important for telecom companies to regularly analyze their data to identify relevant problems and opportunities for improvement.

The aim of this project is to explore the telecom data and find relevant problems faced by telecom operators. By conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large volume of telecom data, we can gain valuable insights into user behavior, network performance, customer demographics, and more. Through this analysis, we hope to identify potential areas for improvement, such as  improving customer satisfaction, optimizing network performance and increasing revenue through targeted marketing efforts.

The insights gained from this project can help telecom operators make informed decisions about their business strategy, enabling them to better meet the needs of their customers and stay competitive in the market.
 
## **Approach**

* Univariate Data Analysis:
    * Create histograms to visualize the distribution of the variables related to the hypotheses.
    * Use countplots to compare the frequencies of different categorical variables with respect to the hypotheses.
    * Create box plots to visualize the median, quartiles, and outliers of the continuous variables with respect to the hypotheses.

* Bivariate Data Analysis:
    * Create scatter plots to investigate the relationship between two continuous variables related to the hypotheses.
    * Create box plots to compare the distributions of the continuous variables with respect to the categorical variables related to the hypotheses.
    * Chi-Square Test and ANOVA:
        * Perform the chi-square test to evaluate the relationship between two categorical variables related to the hypotheses.
        * Use ANOVA to evaluate the difference in means between two or more groups related to the hypotheses.

* Multivariate Data Analysis:
    * Use correlation analysis to investigate the strength and direction of the relationship between multiple continuous variables related to the hypotheses.


* Project Summary:
    * Analyze the results obtained from the above tests to draw conclusions about the hypotheses.
    * Provide recommendations to improve customer satisfaction and retention based on the findings.
 
* Libraries Used:
    * NumPy
    * pandas
    * Matplotlib
    * seaborn
    * scikit-learn
    * Warnings
    * sys
 


## **Project Summary**

In this project, we analyzed a telecom dataset with the aim of identifying insights and making recommendations for the business. We performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to identify patterns and relationships between various variables. 

Through EDA, we identified that the company lacks targeted marketing for specific customers, satisfaction scores are low, and the major reasons for churn were attitude of customer support and competition offering better deals. 
 
 
Our future scope includes implementing machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis, conducting A/B testing, and continuously monitoring and improving customer satisfaction.




### **Recommendations**:

* The company should focus on improving its customer support and services to reduce churn rates and increase customer satisfaction.

* The company should use the demographic and usage patterns of its customers to create targeted marketing campaigns that are more likely to resonate with specific customer segments.

* The company should consider offering incentives to customers who refer friends to use their services, as this can increase customer loyalty and bring in new customers.

* The company should explore ways to increase revenue from customers who generate less revenue, such as by offering targeted promotions or service upgrades.

* The company should continue to monitor its customer satisfaction score and take action to improve it.
